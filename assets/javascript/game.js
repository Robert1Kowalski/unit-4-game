// create variables to track 

 











// The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
// Here's how the app works:

     //a game with 4 crystals and randomResult 
    //every crystal needs to have a random number between 1-12
    //A new number should be generated everytime we win or lost, to those 4 crystals 
    //When clicking any CRYSTAL, it should be adding with the previous result until it equals to the total score
    //If it is greater than the random result, then we lost and decrememt a lost counter
    //If it is equal, then we increment a win counter
